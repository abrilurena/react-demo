This demo is designed to introduce you to [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/), an animation library that simplifies the process of creating animations. With Framer Motion and React.JS, you can build dynamic web apps and deploy them to the Azure Cloud using Azure Static Web Apps.

For a quick introduction, you can visit their website [here](https://www.framer.com/motion/introduction/).

Here’s what you’ll need to keep the demo rolling:

- It is recommended to have basic programming knowledge, familiarity with Git, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.JS.
- An [Azure Subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-abrilu) (to use Azure Static Web Apps)
- A [GitHub account](https://github.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-abrilu).
    > You can still use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-abrilu) to continue with the demo.
- Access to [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)

In the `examples` folder, you will find exercises that we covered during the demo. Feel free to recreate them or try them out at home.
